ðŸ“„ **Project Overview**

SpaceX, a leading company in commercial space travel, has significantly reduced the cost of space launches with its Falcon 9 rocket. By reusing the first stage, SpaceX offers launches at a fraction of the cost compared to other providers. This project aims to predict the reusability of the first stage using public information and machine learning models.

ðŸ“„ **Key Questions**

1. How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits influence the success of the first stage landing?
2. Does the rate of successful landings increase over time?
3. Which algorithm is best suited for binary classification in this scenario?

ðŸ“„ **Methodology**

1. Data Collection
   - Utilized SpaceX Rest API
   - Employed Web Scraping from Wikipedia
2. Data Wrangling
   - Filtered and cleaned the data
   - Handled missing values
   - Utilized One Hot Encoding for binary classification preparation
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Utilized visualization and SQL for analysis
4. Interactive Visual Analytics
   - Leveraged Folium and Plotly Dash for interactive visualizations
5. Predictive Analysis
   - Developed, optimized, and evaluated classification models for accurate predictions
